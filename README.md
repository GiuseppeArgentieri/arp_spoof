# arp_spoof
## An ARP spoofer has been developed to perform a "man-in-the-middle" attack. To run the program (on Linux-based operating systems), type the following command into the terminal:
```console
python main.py -t 192.168.86.133 -g 192.168.86.2
```
or
```console
python main.py --target 192.168.86.133 --gateway 192.168.86.2
```
where:
- 192.168.86.133 is an example target ip address
- 192.168.86.2 is an example gateway ip address
